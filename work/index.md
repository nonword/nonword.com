### NYPL Labs R&amp;D* / Digital

<p class="byline">Late 2012 - Current</p>

I joined the New York Public Library's "it really shouldn't exist but it does" Labs R&amp;D group in late 2012. The group had a mandate to extend the library's special collections through the development of computer vision & crowdsourcing tools. I built a couple iterations of <a href="http://ensemble.nypl.org" target="_blank">Ensemble</a>, an image-region annotation tool for extracting metadata about theater playbills from recently digitized microfilm. I helped with the <a href="http://digitalcollections.nypl.org" target="_blank">Digital Collections</a> reboot and <a href="http://publicdomain.nypl.org/" target="_blank">public domain release</a>.

Since early 2016 I've been helping to rebuild a core property of the library. More on that soon.

\* Labs R&D was quietly dismantled in late 2016 to focus the library's technical staff on core properties.

*Key langauges & tech: Ruby, Mongo, Node, Postgres, ElasticSearch, Tesseract, Opencv*

### Brooklyn Museum

<p class="byline">July 2007 - Sept 2012</p>

I spent nearly 6 years at the Brooklyn Museum, leaving in 2012 as Lead Developer. I contributed to dozens of coding projects including building their first comprehensive <a href="http://brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection" target="_blank">collection online</a>, their <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/opencollection/api" target="_blank">collection API</a>, the voting interface for <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/click/" target="_blank">Click! A crowd curated exhibition</a> and <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/splitsecond" target="_blank">Split Second</a>, and the website and IOS app API for <a href="https://www.brooklynmuseum.org/exhibitions/go/" target="_blank">GO</a>, a Brooklyn-wide open studio event.

*Key languages & tech: PHP, MySQL, Mootools [fight me], Imagemagick, SQL Server, DTS & SSIS*

### Varous Freelance LAMP

<p class="byline">2004 - 2016</p>

I've built websites I've forgotten about at this point, mostly based on PHP & MySQL. Some of them built using FuelPHP, some using Wordpress, and some suffer no framework or discernible methodology. I really like coding and untangling sticky data/system challenges; I frequently forget to bill. **Not taking new work.**

*Key languages & tech: PHP, MySQL, FuelPHP, Wordpress, Macromedia Fireworks [is still the best Web image editor out there], ASP/Access [as required]*


### MTV Networks

<p class="byline">Sept 2004 to July 2006</p>

Helped build MTV Networks' URGE, a digital music subscription service operating inside Microsoft's Windows Media Player 11. Worked with MS developers in Redmond to refine the interface between host app and HTML page, comprising a dozen hooks to read & write application state. I developed much of the framework interfacing with the application layer, including many of the navigation calls. For much of this project, I was the lead Javascript developer. I also wrote much of the PCI compliant front-end account management code.

*Key languages & tech: Javascript, WMP*

### Various Web Programming

<p class="byline">1996 - 2002</p>

At 15, I dialed on to the Web and kind of lost my mind over the then-exploding community of tinkerers freely exchanging code and information design ideas (mostly without qualification) over a brand new medium. I loved to pick up new tricks and pull at the seams. I made handwritten HTML cheatsheets based on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19970529013015/http://htmlgoodies.com/" target="_blank">HTMLGOODIES.com</a> tutorials. I made a site with a clickable image &lt;map/&gt; of my brain and a site about famous vegetarians, their names marqueed across the screen using stolen Javascript (this was years before IE introduced &lt;marquee/&gt;). 

[The Web is still mostly a fundamentally social and creative medium.]

Then I shelved books at my hometown library and rebuilt the website roughly 15 times until they approved the [horrible] design. It has been replaced.

In college, in the middle of a Java heavy CS degree, I helped build <a href="http://vstreet.com" target="_blank">Vstreet.com</a> and looked after a predecessor to <a href="http://www.sociallearning.com/" target="_blank">SocialLearning.com</a>. This was my first taste of server-side dynamic programming. Also my first office job. I wore a tie every day. No one else did.

Then I picked up a remote contract writing PHP over MySQL, so I learned PHP and MySQL. My CS degree suffered, but I did eventually graduate with a thesis on Ajax design patterns to everyone's shame.

*Key languages & tech: Java, JSP, Postgres, HTML, Javascript*
